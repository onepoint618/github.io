		<p>As a global IT Services & Consulting business, the opportunity to address a gap in the market for customers who are early in their cloud digitisation journey was identified. 
		</p><p>
		A new product development team was established, and my responsibility was to lead the integration of the offering into the service management portal. As the only Agile Business Analyst on the team, I was pivotal link between product offering, operational support and Agile (Scrum) portal product development teams.
		</p><p>
The service management portal was successfully integrated into what became an ARN Technology Innovation Award winning &#127942; product in 2022.

		<p>As part of a customer service improvement initiative, a server orchestration and automation product was selected for worldwide deployment to internal DXC accounts. My previous private cloud experience enabled me to perform the Global Technical Product Lead role. Alongside the Global Program Manager, we assessed all DXC accounts for suitability. I also led a team of ServiceNow developers tasked with integrating the product with the corporate IT Service Management framework. Using an Agile approach, centered on a backlog of user stories and regular stand-ups, we were able to progress at a sustainable velocity. 
		</p><p>
               The product solution this dramatically reduced the time to deploy new servers <em>(weeks to minutes)</em>em>, increased standardisation across the server fleet and reduced re-work due to errors.

		In response to multiple feature requests from existing and new customers, a Managed Cloud Service required updating. I was tasked with delivering the high-value collateral as part of Agile (Scrum) software development team for the product upgrade. New epics and user stories were identified for artefacts for non-software components. Each user story captured documentation review for changes, updates or creation as part of the definition of <em>done</em> for the feature.  
		</p><p>
Approximately ~40 artefacts for operations, implementation, training, user and sales & marketing documentation were sucessfully delivered.

		As a business analyst for a large-scale infrastructure transformation project for customer who was starting their cloud journey; I was tasked with validating and remedying a number of significant operational gaps in the private cloud solution being deployed. The scope encompassed the full end-to-end server lifecycle, from initial request to decommissioning.			
		</p><p>
I facilitated the cross-functional workshops, engaging the stakeholders to reach agreement and buy-in. The scope included current/ future state mapping of IT operational process flows, process definition, role allocation and <em>just-enough</em> documentation. Overall service delivery quality and performance was significantly improved and confusion on responsibilities was resolved.

		I was engaged on a private cloud implementation project for a leading Australian tertiary education provider; The requirements for integration and user acceptance testing (UAT) came into scope late, resulting in a project risk which needed to be mitigated.
		</p><p>
		I developed the overall Test Strategy, Test Plan & Test Cases and ensured that all stakeholders were aligned and in agreement. I successfully onboarded and coached the Test Manager and Test Team, ensuring a seamless deployment for the customer. 
I standardized the approach and "templatised" the testing artefacts for future cloud deployment projects. The customer also used the tests as a basis for their own user testing and acceptance.

		<h3>Data Driven Decisions</h3>

The Cloud Services sales team, solution delivery and operational support teams used their own method to track deals, as they progressed to implementation. Data was manually maintained and often incomplete, causing downstream challenges.
			
I designed and built a <em>Deal Lifecycle Tracking</em> prototype (Minimum Viable Product, MVP) to replace 7 Excel spreadsheets. I mapped data from various sources into a single Power BI dashboard, offering stakeholders a consistent data view and basic reporting. This saved time and enabling better business decision making.

                Toolset used was Salesforce, Power BI, Power Query ETL, Power Automate, Excel and SharePoint.

I joined a PMO (Project Management Office) Team to help support the migration of a customers applications to cloud infrastructure. Document governance and management of project operating procedures, reference material and support team processes had become problematic. For example, process descriptions and work instructions couldn't be found, wasting time & effort. 
		</p><p>
I established a SharePoint based documentation library, including categorisation scheme, search facility and <em>request for help</em> process. I defined and negotiated <em>Librarian, Artefact Owner</em> and <em>Library Owner</em> roles with the PMO and gained stakeholder agreement on the approach. After training and launching, the library became the definitive source for the program team.

As a keen <strong>beachcomber</strong>, I find solace and a deep connection with nature along the shoreline. I enjoy collecting sea glass, scouring the sands for those elusive gems that have been shaped by the sea.
<br>
I've got quite a collection now, but finding true blue sea glass remains a thrilling challenge. 
<br>
Exploring another approach, to make my own blue sea glass, I built my own wind-powered rock tumbler. Made completely from re-purposed components (<em>junk?</em>), it is functional, although, there's still some fine-tuning needed. The gearing's a bit too enthusiastic, causing it to spin like a centrifuge rather than gently tumble the glass.
<br>
I have yet to stumble upon a message-in-a-bottle. But the quest continues, and each shoreline visit brings the possibility of discovering a hidden treasure trove of secrets from the sea.

While I can't exactly claim to be a naturally talented gardener, there's something  magical about finding seeds and seeing them sprout from the soil and gradually unfurling their delicate leaves as they grow. 
<br>
It's a simple yet remarkably satisfying to nurture these little green beings, seeing them thrive when given a little bit of care.
<br>
In today's tech-driven world, it's all too easy to lose touch with the simple pleasures of nature. The tangible, tactile act of caring for plants is a grounding experience that helps me find balance in the digital age.

My current home lab is centered around Raspberry Pi experimentation and is where I feed my inner tech enthusiast. 
</p><p>
Currently, it includes a NAS server that takes care of shared storage and backups, housed within a casing I built from a repurposed Cable-TV box generously donated by a friend. 
<br>
I use PiHole to filtering out those pesky ads from the online experience. Home security is covered with a DIY CCTV system that monitors whats going on outside. And a media center, that's a work in progress, promising to elevate my entertainment setup to new heights.
</p><p>
For me, the fun is in successfully hacking something together to meet my needs. It's not just about the technology; it's about learning and using creativity to sucessfuly build useful things that work.

Driven by a previously unsatisfied curiosity about user interface design, particularly websites,  I decided to gain some hands-on experience by creating my own portfolio [here]. I also created a launchpad for my freelance consulting side-hustle website located [here].
<br>
My exploration took me through various approaches, from experimenting Static Site Generators (SSGs) like Hugo and Jekyll with templates, to trying out platforms like Wix and Canva. However, I encountered limitations along the way, so after flirting with Bootstrap, I eventually settled on adapting a raw HTML/CSS/JS template to get more control and flexibility. This journey has been a great learning experience, and now, whenever I encounter a particularly impressive (or not-so-great) website, I can't resist checking out the creator behind it.
